AIM: 
To build a graphql api that can be used in multiple project
Only the models, typedefs, queries, mutations and ENV need to be setup.

Set up express server
Connect to mongodb
Models and typedefs
Setup graphql api
Basic Queries and Mutations
Unions and Interfaces
jwt for security
Auth0 api for login
Permissions

ENV File so that the api can be generic
Models can obviously not be part of the template - but they would be the only things to create
